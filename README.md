# Content-Bsed-Recommendation-System
Content-Based Filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items to users based on 
the characteristics of previously liked or interacted items. It relies on item features and user 
preferences to generate personalized recommendations. 

## Objective
The primary objective of recommendation systems is to enhance user experience by 
providing personalized suggestions that align with individual preferences and needs. These 
systems aim to simplify decision-making for users by filtering through vast amounts of data 
and presenting the most relevant options. 

## Problem Statement
Users on movie streaming platforms often struggle to find content that matches their personal 
tastes due to the overwhelming number of available options. This can lead to frustration and 
reduced engagement. There is a need for an efficient system that simplifies the process by 
offering personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. 

## Methodology
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gather and clean movie metadata (titles, genres, actors, descriptions) to  ensure high-quality data. 
- **Feature Extraction & Representation**: Convert movie attributes into numerical vectors for computational analysis. 
- **Similarity Measurement & Recommendation**: Use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to compute similarity scores and recommend the most similar movies. 
- **Evaluation & Optimization**: Measure accuracy and apply techniques like dimensionality reduction to improve recommendations. 
- **Deployment & Continuous Improvement**: Deploy the system, update it with new data, and refine it over time for better performance.
